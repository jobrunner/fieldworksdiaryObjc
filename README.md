FieldworksDiary
=============
Fieldworks Diary is a small app that should satisfy my personal needs with the work on field trips. And moreover, it is an experiment for me to come away from notebooks of paper. Project is still in progress.

## Installation
Clone repo and call ``pod install`` to setup CocoaPods (pod version 0.32.1) Load the fieldworksdiary.xcworkspace into xcode and build it.
